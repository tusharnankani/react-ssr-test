- `.babelrc`: The `.babelrc` file is your local configuration for your code in your project. It will affect all files that Babel processes that are in the same directory or in sibling directories of the `.babelrc`.
- `.babelrc.json`: An earlier version used a `.babelrc` file (without the .json file extension). This was a configuration file for Babel 6, but this is no longer the case for Babel 7.
